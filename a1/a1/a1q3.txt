Levels of NLP:

1. Morphology: It is where we study words in any language, analyze their structures, the way they are formed and the way they are related to other words.

2. Syntax: It is where we define set of rules for arranging words in sentences and phrases.

3. Phonetics: It is related with the physical sound of the language where we use various computer processing methods. It can be further classified into speech generation and analysis.

4. Phonology: It is mainly concerned about organizing sound (linguistic processing)in the systematic order

5. Semantics: At this stage, we are concerned with the meaning of the words in any language and also how words can be combined into the sentences.

6. Pragmatics: It is about grasping the tone of sentences like how they are said in different situations and how they are interpreted.

7. Discourse: It is about understanding overall structure of the language such as grasping complex inter-sentence, and how previous and next sentence are interpreted.
